We provide merchants with secure full-link virtual asset management capabilities, helping you rapidly build payment and wallet systems. Through standardized APIs, you can achieve:

<Check>Automated user deposit address allocation - Generate multi-chain (e.g. TRON/ETH) standard format wallet addresses on demand</Check>
<Check>Configurable withdrawal process - Support direct processing or enable secondary confirmation (prevent tampering risks via separation of request and execution mechanism)</Check>
<Check>Real-time risk control defense - If merchants configure risk control policies, the system will monitor address risk scores (0-100 points) during deposit and withdrawal processes</Check>
<Check>Event-driven collaboration - Actions such as fund status changes and address replacement are pushed via encrypted Webhook</Check>

  Make asset flows transparent and controllable, security strategies self-mastered !  <Icon icon="shield" size={20} />
