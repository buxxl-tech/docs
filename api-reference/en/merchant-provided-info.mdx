description: 'Merchants need to provide the following information when integrating with the WaaS system:'
---

- **1. Merchant Email:**
  Used to log in to the WaaS back-office management system and receive verification codes for identity authentication during merchant operations.

- **2. Callback URL:**
  The callback URL is a critical interface for the merchant system to receive notifications from the WaaS system, used in the following scenarios:
  - Deposit notifications
  - Withdrawal result callbacks
  - User wallet address change notifications

  **Explanation:**
  WaaS will send notifications to the provided callback URL when specific events occur, informing about operation results or status changes. Merchants must implement the callback interface according to the rules to ensure timely receipt and processing of notifications.

  **Details:** [Webhook Callback](/api-reference/endpoint/en/webhook/callback_overview)


- **3. Withdrawal Request Address (Optional):**
  The purpose of the withdrawal request address depends on whether the secondary confirmation mechanism is enabled:
  - **Without Secondary Confirmation**: Merchants call the `api/order/withdrawWithoutVerify` interface to submit complete withdrawal order information to WaaS in a single step.
  - **With Secondary Confirmation**: Merchants call the `api/order/withdrawRequest` interface to notify WaaS that a user has initiated a withdrawal operation, with specific withdrawal details to be provided through secondary confirmation.

  The secondary confirmation mechanism can be enabled based on merchant requirements. By separating withdrawal requests from information confirmation, it enhances communication security and prevents data tampering and unauthorized operations.

- **4. IP Whitelist:**
  Merchants need to provide the fixed IP address of their server for addition to the IP whitelist. Only addresses in the IP whitelist can access the API interfaces, ensuring system security.
