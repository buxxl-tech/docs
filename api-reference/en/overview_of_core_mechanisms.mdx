To ensure transaction security, the WaaS system adopts an asymmetric RSA encryption mechanism to protect API communication. Each integrated merchant will receive an RSA key pair (1024-bit) generated by WaaS. The public key is used by the merchant for data encryption/decryption, while the private key is securely stored by the WaaS system for server-side encryption/decryption.

    <span> Public Key Acquisition</span>
  </div>
  The WaaS system sends a Base64-encoded RSA public key to merchants via email. (It is recommended that merchants store the public key with secondary AES encryption!!!)

    <span> Private Key Custody</span>
  </div>
  The private key is securely stored by the WaaS system and will not be provided to merchants under any circumstances.
