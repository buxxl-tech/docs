<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Why use 1024-bit RSA instead of longer keys?">
    - Based on a balance between performance and security, 1024-bit RSA provides sufficient security while ensuring API response speed. Contact support for upgrades if higher security is required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. What to do if the public key is lost?">
    - Contact WaaS technical support to regenerate the key pair.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. How to handle decryption failure?" defaultOpen={true}>
    - Verify response status: Check the code value. If not 0, no decryption is needed; handle business errors directly.

    - Validate data format: Ensure data is a valid Base64 string (combination of letters/numbers/+//=).

    - Verify public key consistency: Confirm the same public key is used as for request encryption (distinguish between test/production environments).

    - Check public key handling: Must first decode the Base64-encoded public key string into a byte array before using it for decryption. Do not use the Base64 string directly for decryption.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Why am I getting (Data must not be longer than 128 bytes;) error?" defaultOpen={true}>
    - This error occurs when attempting to decrypt data exceeding 128 bytes. To avoid this, use chunked decryption. Refer to the code examples in the RSA utility class.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Why am I getting (message: &quot;Decryption failed&quot;,code:1005, data:null) error?">
    Usually caused by:

    - ðŸš« Merchant used incorrect RSA public key for encryption (inconsistent with the public key provided by WaaS).

    - ðŸ”„ Merchant failed to properly Base64 decode the public key provided by WaaS before use (note: WaaS provides Base64-encoded public keys that require decoding before use).

    - ðŸ’¾ Issues during request data serialization (e.g., contains non-UTF-8 characters or incorrect JSON format).

    - ðŸ§© Mismatched padding mode or algorithm during encryption (WaaS uses RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding).
