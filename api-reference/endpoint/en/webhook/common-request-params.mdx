All callback types include the following basic parameters, which provide fundamental context information and identification capabilities for the request.


<ParamField path="requestUUID" type="string" required>
  Globally unique request identifier

  **Function:**
  - Serves as the unique identifier for the request
  - Used for request tracking and log recording
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tenantUserId" type="string" required>
  Merchant User ID

  **Important Note:**
  tenantUserId refers to the user ID in the merchant's system, not the merchant's ID in the WaaS system.

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="trackingId" type="string" required>
  Persistent identifier for business events, trackingId is a **permanent identifier** created by the WaaS system for each business event (such as a withdrawal request), remaining unchanged throughout the entire lifecycle of the business event.

  **Core Characteristics**
  1. **Business Event Anchor**
     Uniquely identifies a business event (such as a withdrawal order), with all callbacks from creation to completion sharing the same trackingId

  2. **Retry Identifier**
     When a callback fails and needs to be retried:
     ✅ trackingId remains unchanged
     ❌ requestUUID will be updated to a new value

  3. **Response Correlation Key**
     Merchant must return unchanged in response, used by WaaS to confirm the specific business event to which the callback belongs
</ParamField>


<ParamField path="type" type="integer" required>
  Callback type identifier

  **Enumeration Values:**
  | Value | Enumeration Name              |
  |-------|--------------------------------|
  | 1     | NOTIFY_DEPOSITED           |
  | 2     | NOTIFY_REQUEST_WITHDRAW    |
  | 3     | NOTIFY_WITHDRAW            |
  | 4     | NOTIFY_ADDRESS             |
  | 5     | NOTIFY_INVALID_ADDRESS     |

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="business" type="int" required>
  Tenant type identifier

  **Current Version Description:**
  This field is a reserved parameter with no business logic function in the current version. It is reserved to support possible future expansion needs.

  **Intended Use:**
  - Distinguish processing logic for different business lines
  - Identify special rates or rule applications
  - Tenant identification in multi-tenant systems

  **Best Practice:**
  Although currently without business logic function, it should still be preserved and recorded in request processing to avoid compatibility issues in future expansions.

  **Example Value:** `0`
